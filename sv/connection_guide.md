*If you can't install the certificate properly, follow [these instructions](https://ripple.moe/index.php?p=16&id=12) to install it manually.*

### How to play on Ripple

- Make sure **Ripple IP** is **163.172.71.251** and **Mirror IP** is **37.187.125.67**. If not, click **Update IP** to get the right IPs.
- Make sure that the switcher says **"You are playing on Ripple server 163.172.71.251 - 37.187.125.67"** (it should look like [this](https://b.catgirlsare.sexy/xqJw.png)), if not, click **"On/Off"** to switch server.
